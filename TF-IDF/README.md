Used a corpus on the State of the Union speeches. The TF-IDF values were calculated for each term in the corpus.
There were 2 objectives:
1 - Find the highest weighted 20 terms and based on them decide what the speech was about
2 - Find the highest weighted terms for each decade and connect these to major historical events

Through this work, we concluded what the major events were in the 60's decade according to the most relevant words in these speeches.
Using the same approach, we found the key events of the entire last century.
We also did an analysis on what kind of events should've come up in this method.

Worked in collaboration with Acaua Sperl de Faria
