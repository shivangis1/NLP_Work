In this work, we analyzed a social network using three different centrality algorithms, and compared the results.

The dataset used was a network extracted from the French novel Les Miserables, where each node is a character and there is an edge between two characters if they appear in the same chapter.

Working with different centrality measures (degree, closeness & betweenness),  we analyzed which measure would make more sense in this case.

Worked in collaboration with Acaua Sperl de Faria.
