Doctors say alcohol should come with calorie labels

In the <a href = "http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/country/ralg-geo1/152649df-347e-e289-1a9e-acc883e07d17" target="_blank">United States</a> and the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union" target="_blank">European Union</a>, alcoholic beverages aren’t required to be labeled with nutritional facts. That’s a problem, according to public health experts from The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_for_Public_Health" target="_blank">Royal Society for Public Health</a>, a British nonprofit organization. The RSPH released a report this week calling for <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_products" target="_blank">alcohol products</a> in the EU to be labeled with caloric information.

The argument is straightforward. <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity" target="_blank">Obesity</a> is a global <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epidemic" target="_blank">epidemic</a>: in <a href = "http://d.opencalais.com/er/geo/country/ralg-geo1/9cdc126f-6826-0cbd-df3a-00a4032f0e7e" target="_blank">United Kingdom</a>, for example, a quarter of adults are obese, while in the US the proportion is 35%. Adults who drink get around 10% of their total calories from alcohol. And a survey of adults in the UK commissioned by the RSPH showed that 60 to 80% of people didn’t know or underestimated the caloric content of beer or wine.

Nutritional labels, then, should be a no-brainer: if people are aware of the calories they’re consuming, they can make smarter choices.

If it’s so obvious, why aren’t labels already required? One reason is that labels would put a cost burden on industry players such as wineries: they would be required to analyze every variety of wine they produce for nutritional content.

There’s also the matter of government resources. In the US, <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nutritional_food_labels" target="_blank">nutritional food labels</a> are regulated by the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" target="_blank">Food and Drug Administration</a>, but alcohol labels are in the domain of the Alcohol and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Tax_and_Trade_Bureau" target="_blank">Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau</a>. <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Zahn" target="_blank">Lindsey Zahn</a>, a <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/food_and_beverage_lawyer" target="_blank">food and beverage lawyer</a>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beverage" target="_blank">beverage</a> lawyer at Lehrman Beverage Law, writes that “TTB does not have the resources at this time to review a full nutrition facts panel.”

Still, some companies are labeling beverages by choice. If this grows in popularity, perhaps the law will be forced to catch up.

For those keeping score, a 5-ounce (148 ml) glass of wine contains around 120 calories, while 12 ounces (355 ml) of beer contains 150 calories.
